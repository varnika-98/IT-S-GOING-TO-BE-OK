# IT-S-GOING-TO-BE-OK

Itâ€™s Going To Be Ok Inc. (IGBOK) is an organization founded by Dr. Tonya Stafford-Manning, a survivor of human trafficking, with the aim of assisting and empowering human trafficking survivors. The organization focuses on rescue, restoration, and education, working diligently to eradicate human trafficking one survivor at a time.

As part of a collaborative effort, I participated in a three-day open event where Salesforce enthusiasts and specialists came together to build a Salesforce IGBOK org specifically for Dr. Tonya and her team.

# Within The Project
Within this project, I was a member of the Usability Team, which played a crucial role in developing a fully functional org that would enable Dr. Tonya and her team to transition from pen and paper to a streamlined and easily manageable system.
My responsibilities within the Usability Team included thoroughly understanding the requirements of Dr. Tonya and her team to enhance user experience. I created a comprehensive flowchart outlining the structure and layout of the org pages. Additionally, I developed user personas to represent the various individuals who would be utilizing the IGBOK org, facilitating a user-centric approach.

# Salesforce Process Builder
To ensure an intuitive and interactive user experience, I implemented customizations using Process Builder and Flow Builder, harnessing their capabilities to automate processes and simplify workflows. I also deployed these customizations to a sandbox environment for comprehensive testing.

Moreover, I utilized Apex, Salesforce's proprietary programming language, to develop custom functionalities that addressed specific needs identified during the requirements gathering phase.
By contributing to the Usability Team, I played an instrumental role in creating an org that not only met the unique requirements of IGBOK but also provided a seamless and convenient experience for Dr. Tonya and her team.Feel free to tailor the description further to fit your specific experiences and accomplishments within the Usability Team.
